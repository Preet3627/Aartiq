### eddzsh

> *Security Architecture · Electron IPC Trust Boundary · Approval System Design*

**Reddit:** [eddzsh](https://www.reddit.com/user/eddzsh)

eddzsh is the security architect behind Aartiq's ticket-based approval system. Through detailed discussions on r/electronjs, he designed the exact pattern Aartiq now uses for its permission model. His contributions include:

- **Ticket-Based Approval Pattern:** Designed the signed ticket system where main process issues a request ID, stores exact params server-side, and only lets the approval event redeem that specific ticket
- **Hash Verification at Propose Time:** Proposed hashing the exact payload at propose time and diffing it against execution — catching race conditions where the AI assembles different params after approval
- **Pre-Registered Call Shapes:** Designed the system for unattended/scheduled execution where exact call shapes (tool + fixed args) are registered during interactive sessions and verified at runtime
- **Pattern-Based Approval:** Suggested scoping approvals to patterns instead of literal values for scheduled tasks with variable args (e.g., dated filenames)
- **Trust Boundary Design:** Articulated the core principle that "nothing stops params being tampered with in transit" and built the foundation to prevent it

### Dxrkaa

- **First Issue Report:** Opened [Issue #6](https://github.com/Preet3627/Aartiq/issues/6) reporting that the latest version failed to launch on Windows (process running in Task Manager but no window visible)
- **Early Adoption:** Was among the first external users to install and test Aartiq on Windows
- **Bug Discovery:** Identified a critical launch regression that was fixed in v0.2.9
- **Community Catalyst:** The first issue report marked the beginning of Aartiq's public bug-tracking lifecycle
